# MidTerm
The mid term project of the interface programming course: all the exercises have been developed by using the F# programming language.

The files in the repository are the following ones:

| File | Description |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
`lwc.fsx` | it is used for creating the User Controls
`puzzle1.fsx` | it is the solution of the first exercise
`Exercise3and4.fsx` | it is the solution of the third and fourth exercises (the fourth, is an extension of the third one)
`worldview.fsx` | it consists of the implementation of the transformation matrices needed for moving the view upon the various graphics controls.


The `corgi.jpg` file is not present in the repository and it's been hardcoded in the solution of the `Exercise3and4.fsx` file, since it was needed for testing the exercise.
If you want to use the code in the exercise, feel free to rename that name with a name of an image present into the same directory of the sources.
